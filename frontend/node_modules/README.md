## Overview

The Retail Sales Management System provides a responsive dashboard over one million retail transactions.
It exposes an Express.js API that delivers server-side search, filtering, sorting, and pagination.
The React + Vite frontend renders an interactive shadcn-inspired UI with live controls and summary analytics.

- React 18, Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn-inspired styling
- csv-parse for dataset ingestion

## Search Implementation Summary

Backend normalizes customer names and phone numbers and searches them via indexed datasets.
Frontend binds the header search box to live queries so every keystroke re-fetches paged API results.

## Filter Implementation Summary

Server builds in-memory indexes for region, gender, category, payment, and tags to resolve filter intersections quickly.
Client fetches dynamic filter metadata, renders dropdown chips, and syncs selections through a shared filter state.

## Sorting Implementation Summary

Sorted index arrays are precomputed for date, quantity, and customer name; pagination slices them without resorting.
Dropdown selection updates the sort parameters, ensuring consistent ordering alongside active search and filters.

## Pagination Implementation Summary

The service calculates totals using sorted index positions and only materializes the requested page window.
Client pagination controls request specific pages while preserving search, filter, and sorting state.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `cd backend && npm install`, then `cd ../frontend && npm install`.

3. Start the backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`.
4. In a second terminal, start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`.
5. Open the reported Vite URL in a browser to interact with the dashboard.
